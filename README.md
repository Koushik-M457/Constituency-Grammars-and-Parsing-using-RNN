# Constituency-Grammars-and-Parsing-using-RNN
Constituency parsing is the process of analyzing the syntactic structure of a sentence, breaking it down into constituent parts such as noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), and others. It is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding sentence structure and syntax.  In this project, we build a Constituency Parsing.
